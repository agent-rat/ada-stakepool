## Overview
We are now in ITN testnet phase. To support the Cardano network, I have setup a testnet ITN node in Melbourne, Australia on my own home network. 

## Current setup
The node is currently hosted on docker on my local home internet via Optus network

## Moving forward
### Decentralisation
When the node turns to self-funding, I will look into having it added on local datacentres as we need the Cardano network to be decentrialised across the world. I am a firm believer that having nodes hosted on cloud solutions such as AWS, Azure and other large provider is a great for most things, but fundamentally this is in contrast with decentralisation where we want things to be not under a single point of failure.
