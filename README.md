## Overview
We are now in ITN testnet phase. This is a historical moment! 

Please delegate your test ADA to my stakepool.

Stakepool Id is 5d099136e633d00f53be23c36300f2bfa465fd83f53474dea091042b232b393c
Jormungandr version is 0.8.3

## Current setup
To support the Cardano network, I have setup a testnet ITN node in Melbourne, Australia. The node is currently hosted on docker on my local home internet via Optus network. 

## Moving forward
### Decentralisation
When the node turns to self-funding, I will look into having it added on local datacentres as we need the Cardano network to be decentrialised across the world. I am a firm believer that having nodes hosted on cloud solutions such as AWS, Azure and other large provider is a great for most things, but fundamentally this is in contrast with decentralisation where we want things to be not under a single point of failure.

### More to come...
